This repository contains notes on programming in the system programming languages C and C++, as well as assembly (x86).
This includes using Make and CMake and platform-specific topics such as the compilation of static vs. dynamic libraries.
using platform-specific APIs (Win32), debugging, profiling, etc. Take it as my personal notes and playground, but I
I think this can be useful for a wider audience. At this moment, it is quite a mess, but I will be glad if you send me some
tip, orÂ correction and of my mistakes.
